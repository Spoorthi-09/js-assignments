    <h2>Datatypes in Javascript</h2>
    <h3>1. number</h3>
    <p>The number type represents both integer and floating point numbers.<br>

    There are many operations for numbers, e.g. multiplication *, division /, addition +, subtraction -, and so on.<br>
        
    Besides regular numbers, there are so-called “special numeric values” which also belong to this data type: Infinity, -Infinity and NaN.</p>
    <script>
        let n = 123;
        n = 12.345;

        console.log( 1 / 0 ); // Infinity
        console.log( "not a number" / 2 + 5 ); // NaN

    </script>

    <!--BigInt-->
    <h3>2. BigInt</h3>
    <p>BigInt type was recently added to the language to represent integers of arbitrary length.<br>

    A BigInt value is created by appending n to the end of an integer:</p>
    <script>
        const bigInt = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;
    </script>

    <!--String-->
    <h3>3. String</h3>
    <p>A string in JavaScript must be surrounded by quotes.<br>
    Double and single quotes are “simple” quotes. There’s practically no difference between them in JavaScript.
        <br>
    Backticks are “extended functionality” quotes. They allow us to embed variables and expressions into a string by wrapping them in ${…}.
    </p>
    <script>
    let name = "John";

    // embed a variable
    console.log( `Hello, ${name}!` ); // Hello, John!

    // embed an expression
    console.log( `the result is ${1 + 2}` ); // the result is 3

    console.log( "the result is ${1 + 2}" ); // the result is ${1 + 2} (double quotes do nothing)

    </script>

    <!--boolean-->
    <h3>4. Boolean</h3>
    <p>
    The boolean type has only two values: true and false.
        <br>
    This type is commonly used to store yes/no values: true means “yes, correct”, and false means “no, incorrect”.
    </p>
    <script>
        //for instance
        let x = true;
        let y = false;
        //comparision
        let z = 5>10;
        console.log(z);//false
    </script>

    <!--The "null" value-->
    <h3>5. null</h3>
    <p>
        It forms a separate type which contains null value only.
    </p>
    <script>
        let po = null;
    </script>

    <!--The "undefined" value-->
    <h3>6. undefined</h3>
    <p>
        It means that the value is not defined.
        <br>
        If a variable is declared, but not assigned, then its value is undefined.
    </p>
    <script>
        let za;
        console.log(za);//undefined
    </script>

    <!--object-->
    <h3>7.Object type</h3>
    <p>
        The object type is special.
        <br>
        All other types are called “primitive” because their values can contain only a single thing (be it a string or a number or whatever). In contrast, objects are used to store collections of data and more complex entities.
    </p>

    <!--symbols-->
    <h3>8. Symbol</h3>
    <p>
        The symbol type is used to create unique identifiers for objects.
    </p>

    <!--typeof operator-->
    <h3>The typeof operator</h3>
    <p>
        The typeof operator returns the type of the argument. It’s useful when we want to process values of different types differently or just want to do a quick check.<br>

        It supports two forms of syntax:<br>

        As an operator: typeof x.<br>
        As a function: typeof(x).<br>
        In other words, it works with parentheses or without them. The result is the same.<br>
    </p>
    <script>
        console.log(typeof undefined) // "undefined"

        console.log(typeof 200) // "number"

        console.log(typeof 700n) // "bigint"

        console.log(typeof true) // "boolean"

        console.log(typeof "LetsUpgrade") // "string"

        console.log(typeof Symbol("id")) // "symbol"

    </script>
